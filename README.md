# Toy implementation of the ChatGPT client in Elm

To try this out, create a `src/Secrets.elm` file (which is in `.gitignore`) and fill in your ChatGPT API key:

```
module Secrets exposing (..)

key = "sk-lor3m1psumd0lor"
```

You can then run it by starting `elm reactor` and navigating to `src/Main.elm`.
